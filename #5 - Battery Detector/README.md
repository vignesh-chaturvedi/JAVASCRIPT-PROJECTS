# _Script.js Explanation_

This JavaScript code is used to display and update the battery status information on a webpage. Here is a breakdown of the code:

1.  The `initBattery()` function is called at the beginning to initialize the battery functionality.

2.  The code selects various elements from the HTML using `document.querySelector()` and assigns them to variables. These elements include the battery liquid element, battery status element, and battery percentage element.

3.  `navigator.getBattery()` is used to obtain the battery information of the device. The returned `batt` object represents the battery status and provides properties and events related to the battery.

4.  Inside the `updateBattery()` function, the battery level is retrieved from `batt.level` and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. The battery percentage is then displayed in the HTML using `Bpercentage.innerHTML`.

5.  The height of the battery liquid element (`batteryLiquid.style.height`) is adjusted based on the battery level to visually represent the current battery level.

6.  Depending on the battery level and charging status, different messages and icons are displayed in the battery status element (`batteryStatus.innerHTML`).

7.  Conditional statements are used to add and remove CSS classes from the battery liquid element based on the battery level. These classes control the gradient colors applied to the battery liquid, providing a visual representation of the battery level.

8.  The `updateBattery()` function is initially called to set the initial battery status.

9.  Event listeners are added to the battery object (`batt`) for the `chargingchange` and `levelchange` events. These events trigger the `updateBattery()` function when there are changes in the battery charging status or level.

Overall, this code provides a dynamic representation of the battery status on a webpage, updating the display based on the current battery level and charging status.
