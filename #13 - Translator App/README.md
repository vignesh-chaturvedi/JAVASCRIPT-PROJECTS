## _Script.js Explanation_

\
This code snippet is responsible for implementing a translation feature on a webpage. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.  The `const` keyword is used to declare constant variables `fromText`, `toText`, `exchangeIcon`, `selectTag`, `icons`, and `translateBtn`, and assigns them with corresponding elements retrieved from the DOM using `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`.

2.  The `forEach` loop iterates over each `select` element in `selectTag` and generates `option` elements based on the `countries` object. The generated options are appended to the respective `select` element using `insertAdjacentHTML`.

3.  An event listener is added to the `exchangeIcon` element, which listens for a `'click'` event. When the event occurs (user clicks the exchange icon), the callback function is executed.

4.  Inside the callback function, the values and selected options of the input fields and select elements are swapped.

5.  An event listener is added to the `fromText` element, which listens for a `'keyup'` event. When the event occurs (user releases a key in the input field), the callback function is executed.

6.  Inside the callback function, if the `fromText` input field is empty, the `toText` input field is cleared.

7.  An event listener is added to the `translateBtn` element, which listens for a `'click'` event. When the event occurs (user clicks the translate button), the callback function is executed.

8.  Inside the callback function, the text to be translated, the selected translation languages, and the API URL are extracted.

9.  The API URL is constructed using the text and translation languages.

10. A fetch request is made to the translation API using the constructed API URL. The response is handled using promises. The translated text is extracted from the response and assigned to the `toText` input field.

11. The `matches` property of the response is iterated over, and if the `id` is `0`, the translation is assigned to the `toText` input field.

12. The placeholder of the `toText` input field is updated to indicate the translation status.

13. Event listeners are added to each `icon` element in the `icons` collection. When an icon is clicked, the callback function is executed.

14. Inside the callback function, depending on the clicked icon (`fa-copy` or `fa-volume-up`), the corresponding text is copied to the clipboard or synthesized as speech using the appropriate language.

Overall, this code enables translation functionality on a webpage, allowing users to enter text, select languages, translate the text, and perform actions such as copying and listening to the translated text.
