# _Index.js Explanation_

This code snippet is responsible for maintaining an aspect ratio between the width and height values based on user input. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.  The `let` keyword is used to declare variables `ratioWidth`, `ratioHeight`, `width`, and `height` and assigns them with corresponding elements retrieved from the DOM using `getElementById`.

2.  The `calculateWidth` function is defined to calculate the width value based on the current aspect ratio and the height value. It calculates the aspect ratio by dividing the ratioWidth value by the ratioHeight value. Then, it updates the width value by multiplying the height value with the aspect ratio. The result is rounded to 2 decimal places using `toFixed` and parsed as a float.

3.  The `calculateHeight` function is defined to calculate the height value based on the current aspect ratio and the width value. It calculates the aspect ratio in the same way as `calculateWidth`. Then, it updates the height value by dividing the width value by the aspect ratio. The result is rounded to 2 decimal places using `toFixed` and parsed as a float.

4.  Event listeners are added to the height, width, ratioHeight, and ratioWidth elements. When the height value is modified (`"input"` event), the `calculateWidth` function is triggered to update the width value. When the width, ratioHeight, or ratioWidth value is modified, the `calculateHeight` function is triggered to update the height value.

Overall, this code ensures that whenever the user modifies the height, width, or aspect ratio values, the corresponding value is automatically recalculated to maintain the desired aspect ratio between width and height.
