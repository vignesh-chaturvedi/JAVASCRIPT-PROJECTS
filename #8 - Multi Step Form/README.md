# _Index.js Explanation_

This code snippet is responsible for handling a multi-step form with progress indicators. It allows users to navigate between different sections of the form using Next and Back buttons. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.  The `var` keyword is used to declare variables `form1`, `form2`, `form3`, `next1`, `next2`, `back1`, `back2`, and `progress` and assigns them with corresponding elements retrieved from the DOM using `getElementById`.

2.  The `next1.onclick` function is triggered when the Next button in the first section is clicked. It moves the form1 element to the left (hiding it), moves the form2 element to the right (displaying it), and expands the progress indicator width to show progress. This transition simulates moving to the next step of the form.

3.  The `back1.onclick` function is triggered when the Back button in the second section is clicked. It reverses the transition done by the `next1.onclick` function. It moves the form1 element back to the right (displaying it), moves the form2 element back to the left (hiding it), and reduces the progress indicator width to go back to the previous step.

4.  Similarly, `next2.onclick` and `back2.onclick` functions handle the transitions between the second and third sections of the form.

5.  The style modifications performed by the onclick functions update the position (`left` property) of the form elements, controlling their visibility, and adjust the width of the progress indicator (`progress` element) to reflect the progress made in the form.

Overall, this code enables a smooth transition between different sections of a multi-step form, providing a clear visual indication of the progress made by the user.
