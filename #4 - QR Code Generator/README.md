# _Script.js Explanation_

This JavaScript code is responsible for generating and manipulating a QR code dynamically. Let's break it down step by step:

1.  Variable Declarations:

    -   `download`: Represents an element with the class name "download".
    -   `dark`: Represents an element with the class name "dark".
    -   `light`: Represents an element with the class name "light".
    -   `qrContainer`: Represents an element with the ID "qr-code".
    -   `qrText`: Represents an element with the class name "qr-text".
    -   `shareBtn`: Represents an element with the class name "share-btn".
    -   `sizes`: Represents an element with the class name "sizes".
2.  Event Listeners:

    -   The `dark` element has an input event listener that calls the `handleDarkColor` function when its value changes.
    -   The `light` element has an input event listener that calls the `handleLightColor` function when its value changes.
    -   The `qrText` element has an input event listener that calls the `handleQRText` function when its value changes.
    -   The `sizes` element has a change event listener that calls the `handleSize` function when its value changes.
    -   The `shareBtn` element has a click event listener that calls the `handleShare` function.
3.  Variable Initialization:

    -   `defaultUrl`: Represents the default URL for the QR code.
    -   `colorLight`: Represents the color value for the light areas of the QR code (initialized to "#fff").
    -   `colorDark`: Represents the color value for the dark areas of the QR code (initialized to "#000").
    -   `text`: Represents the text or URL for the QR code (initialized to `defaultUrl`).
    -   `size`: Represents the size of the QR code image (initialized to 300).
4.  Function Definitions:

    -   `handleDarkColor`: Updates the `colorDark` variable with the selected value and calls `generateQRCode()` to regenerate the QR code.
    -   `handleLightColor`: Updates the `colorLight` variable with the selected value and calls `generateQRCode()` to regenerate the QR code.
    -   `handleQRText`: Updates the `text` variable with the entered value and calls `generateQRCode()` to regenerate the QR code. If the value is empty, it reverts to the `defaultUrl`.
    -   `generateQRCode`: Generates the QR code using the `QRCode` library. It clears the `qrContainer`, creates a new QR code based on the `text`, `size`, `colorLight`, and `colorDark` variables, and updates the download link (`download.href`) with the resolved data URL.
    -   `handleShare`: Handles the sharing of the QR code image. It waits for a brief moment and then attempts to create a `File` from the resolved data URL and share it using the Web Share API. If the browser does not support sharing, it displays an alert message.
    -   `handleSize`: Updates the `size` variable with the selected value and calls `generateQRCode()` to regenerate the QR code.
    -   `resolveDataUrl`: Resolves the data URL of the QR code image. It waits for a short delay, checks if the image (`img`) has a current source (`img.currentSrc`), and resolves with the current source URL. If the current source is not available, it resolves with the data URL of the `canvas` element.
5.  Initialization:

    -   The `generateQRCode` function is called initially to generate the QR code based on the default values.

Overall, this code sets up event listeners to handle user interactions, generates and updates the QR code based on selected options, and provides functionality to download and share the generated QR code.
