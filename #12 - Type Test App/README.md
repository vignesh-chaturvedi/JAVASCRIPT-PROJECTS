## _Index.js Explanation_

The provided JavaScript code appears to be a typing speed test application. Let's go through it line by line:

`const quoteApiUrl = "https://api.quotable.io/random?minLength=80&maxLength=100";
const quoteSection = document.getElementById("quote");
const userInput = document.getElementById("quote-input");`

-   This section defines three variables:
    -   `quoteApiUrl` represents the URL of the API that provides random quotes.
    -   `quoteSection` references an HTML element with the id "quote" that will display the quote.
    -   `userInput` references an HTML input element with the id "quote-input" where the user enters their typed text.


`let quote = "";
let time = 60;
let timer = "";
let mistakes = 0;`

-   Here, four variables are declared and initialized:
    -   `quote` is a string that will hold the randomly fetched quote.
    -   `time` represents the duration of the typing test in seconds (initially set to 60).
    -   `timer` is used to store the timer interval.
    -   `mistakes` keeps track of the number of mistakes made during typing.


`const renderNewQuote = async () => {
//Fetch content from quote api url
const response = await fetch(quoteApiUrl);
let data = await response.json();
quote = data.content;

    //Array of chars in quote
    let arr = quote.split("").map((value) => {
        return "<span class='quote-chars'>" + value + "</span>";
    });
    quoteSection.innerHTML += arr.join("");

-   This function `renderNewQuote` is an asynchronous function that fetches a random quote from the specified API.
-   The API response is converted to JSON format, and the `quote` variable is assigned the value of the quote content.
-   The quote content is split into an array of characters, and each character is wrapped in a `span` element with the class "quote-chars".
-   The resulting array is joined into a string, which is then appended to the `quoteSection` element.

`userInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
// ...
});`

-   This event listener listens for any input events on the `userInput` element, which is the input field where the user types their text.


`let quoteChars = document.querySelectorAll(".quote-chars");
quoteChars = Array.from(quoteChars);`

-   This code selects all elements with the class "quote-chars" using `querySelectorAll`.
-   It then converts the resulting NodeList into an array using `Array.from()`.


`quoteChars.forEach((char, index) => {
// ...
});`

-   This loop iterates through each character element in the `quoteChars` array.


`if (char.innerText == userInputChars[index]) {
char.classList.add("success");
} else if (userInputChars[index] == null) {
// ...
} else {
// ...
}`

-   These conditional statements check if the typed character matches the corresponding character in the quote.
-   If there is a match, the "success" class is added to the character element, indicating a correct input.
-   If the typed character is null (when the user deletes characters), the classes "success" or "fail" are removed accordingly.
-   If the typed character is incorrect, the "fail" class is added to the character element, and the `mistakes` count is incremented.
-   The number of mistakes is displayed in an element with the id "mistakes".


`let check = quoteChars.every((element) => {
return element.classList.contains("success");
});

if (check) {
displayResult();
}`

-   This code checks if all the characters in the quote have the "success" class, indicating that the user has typed the entire quote correctly.
-   If all characters are correct, the `displayResult` function is called.


`function updateTimer() {
// ...
}

const timeReduce = () => {
// ...
}`

-   The `updateTimer` function is defined to update the timer display by reducing the remaining time by 1 second.
-   The `timeReduce` function resets the time to 60 seconds and sets up the timer interval using `setInterval`.


`const displayResult = () => {
// ...
}

const startTest = () => {
// ...
}`

-   The `displayResult` function is called when the typing test ends. It displays the result by showing a result div, stopping the timer, disabling the input field, and calculating the words per minute (wpm) and accuracy of the typed text.
-   The `startTest` function is called when the typing test begins. It resets the mistakes count, enables the input field, starts the timer, and hides the start button.

`window.onload = () => {
// ...
}`

-   This code runs when the window finishes loading.
-   It sets the initial state by resetting the input field value, showing the start button, hiding the stop button, disabling the input field, and rendering a new random quote using the `renderNewQuote` function.

That's a summary of the provided JavaScript code. It seems to be a basic typing speed test that fetches random quotes, compares user input with the quote, and calculates typing speed and accuracy. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
