# _Index.js Explanation_

This JavaScript code is for a simple tic-tac-toe game. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1.  Variable Declarations:

    -   `playerTurn`: Represents the current player's turn (initially set to "x").
    -   `moves`: Tracks the number of moves made (initially set to 0).
    -   `isGameOver`: Tracks whether the game is over or not (initially set to false).
    -   `span`: Stores the collection of `<span>` elements.
    -   `restartButton`: HTML markup for a restart button, represented as a string.
2.  Function Definitions:

    -   `play(y)`: Handles the game logic when a player makes a move. It checks if the selected cell (`y`) is available and updates the cell with the current player's mark. It then checks for a win condition by calling the `checkWinner` function for various combinations of cells. If there is no winner after 9 moves, it calls the `draw` function.
    -   `checkWinner(a, b, c)`: Checks if the combination of cells (specified by `a`, `b`, and `c`) results in a win for a player. It compares the dataset values of the cells and checks if they belong to the same player ("x" or "o"). If a win condition is met, it highlights the winning cells and calls the `gameOver` function.
    -   `playAgain()`: Resets the game by removing the game over alert, resetting the game state, removing the activeBox class from cells, and setting `isGameOver` to false.
    -   `resetGame()`: Resets the game state by setting the dataset values of all cells to "none" and clearing their innerHTML.
    -   `gameOver(a)`: Handles the game over scenario. It displays an alert message declaring the winner and offers a restart button. It sets `isGameOver` to true and resets the number of moves.
    -   `draw()`: Handles the scenario where there is no winner (a draw). It displays an alert message for a draw and offers a restart button. It sets `isGameOver` to true and resets the number of moves.

The code uses the `span` elements to represent the cells of the tic-tac-toe grid. When a player makes a move, it checks for win conditions and handles game over scenarios. It provides functionality to restart the game and keeps track of the game state.

Note: The HTML structure and related styles are not provided in this code snippet, but they would be necessary for the game to function properly.
