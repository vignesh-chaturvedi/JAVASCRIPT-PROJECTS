This JavaScript code fetches data from the CoinGecko API to get the current prices and 24-hour price changes for several cryptocurrencies. Let's break it down line by line:

`fetch('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin%2Ctether%2Cethereum%2Clitecoin%2Ccardano%2Cdogecoin&vs_currencies=usd&include_24hr_change=true')
.then(res => res.json())
.then(json => {
// ...
});`

-   The `fetch` function is used to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, which is the CoinGecko API endpoint. This endpoint provides information about the prices and 24-hour changes of the selected cryptocurrencies.
-   The response is handled using the promise-based syntax `then`, which allows us to perform actions once the response is received and processed.

`const container = document.querySelector('.container');
const coins = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(json);`

-   The `container` variable references an HTML element with the class "container". This element will hold the dynamically generated content for each cryptocurrency.
-   The `coins` variable is assigned an array of strings representing the property names of the `json` object. These property names correspond to the cryptocurrencies fetched from the API.

`for (let coin of coins) {
const coinInfo = json[`${coin}`];
const price = coinInfo.usd;
const change = coinInfo.usd_24h_change.toFixed(5);

    container.innerHTML += `
        <div class="coin ${change < 0 ? 'falling' : 'rising'}">
            <div class="coin-logo">
                <img src="images/${coin}.png">
            </div>
            <div class="coin-name">
                <h3>${coin}</h3>
                <span>/USD</span>
            </div>
            <div class="coin-price">
                <span class="price">$${price}</span>
                <span class="change">${change}</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    `;

-   This loop iterates over each cryptocurrency in the `coins` array.
-   For each cryptocurrency, it retrieves the corresponding information from the `json` object using the property name as the key.
-   The `price` variable stores the current price of the cryptocurrency in USD.
-   The `change` variable stores the 24-hour price change of the cryptocurrency, with a maximum of 5 decimal places.
-   The content for each cryptocurrency is dynamically generated using a template literal and appended to the `container` element's inner HTML.
-   The generated HTML includes the cryptocurrency logo, name, price, and the class "coin" with either "falling" or "rising" based on the value of the `change` variable.

Overall, this code fetches cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API and dynamically creates HTML elements to display the current prices and 24-hour price changes for each cryptocurrency. The resulting content is appended to the specified container element.
